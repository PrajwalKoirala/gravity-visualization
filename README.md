# gravity-visualization
This webapp makes it easy to tweak the mass properties of two particles in the space and observe their behaviour. Edit the code and change the mass properties of the object named as 'planet' and 'satellite'. Change their initial position and velocity and observe the effect.

This mini-project can be used to teach 'Newton's law of gravitation' to highschool students. They can be taught how magnitude and direction of the forces between the particles are being calculated at every instant, and how the position is being updated. This can be then related with the examples of solar system, binary stars, etc.
